    | You might be wondering why I asked these questions? What was I trying to make you realize? What is the point of this survey? What will I do by getting to know which part of you is the most intriguing?
    | Well, here&apos;s the thing:
    br
    |                 To begin with, I want you to sit back and relax. Calm yourself cause I am gonna tell you some fantastic things.
    br
    |                 While answering my questions, you took some of your precious time and thought about the strongest, most beautiful, sexiest, and the part you would never change of your body. You already knew these facts about yourself. But, did you ever sit down and give a thought about these facts? If yes, then how many times?
    br
    |                 While answering these questions, if not consciously, then subconsciously, you appreciated yourself. You felt proud of your strongest trait which can beat any obstacle in your way. You felt happy about the most beautiful and sexiest personalities of you that can put charm anywhere you go :). You felt contented with the part of your personality which you would never like to change.
    |                 This appreciation for your body, for yourself, makes the change. We get so busy with our routines, that we don&apos;t give time to ourselves. And then we lack the realizations about our own personality. And when we lack confidence in ourselves, cause we didn&apos;t give us enough time and didn&apos;t let our thoughts sink in, we let others&apos; thoughts sink in.
    br
    |                 So, next time, whenever any fool tries to body shame you, think about what you believe. Do you love your body? Do you love how your body treats you? Are you grateful to your body for working as it does? If yes, then screw other people.
    br
    |                 Next time, whenever someone says something mean to you, you say this to yourself:
    br
    |  I love myself. These people are doing what they are meant to do: feel happy by making others feel bad. Let them be happy. I know that I love myself and my body. I won't let their words sink in.
